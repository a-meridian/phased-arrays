geometry. This suggests they are “receiving” geometric templates from
the morphic field.</p>

<p><strong>The Cosmic Dodecahedron</strong>: Analysis of CMB data
suggests the universe may have finite dodecahedral topology (Poincaré
dodecahedral space). The same Platonic form appearing at the largest
possible scale.</p>
<p><strong>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations</strong>: The 490 million
light-year “ruler” detected in galaxy distribution is a literal standing
wave imprint—structure frozen from sound waves in the early
universe.</p>
<h3 id="morphic-resonance-evidence">9.6 Morphic Resonance Evidence</h3>
<p><strong>Crystallization Studies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Xylitol crystallization (1987)</strong>: Novel crystal
form was initially difficult to produce. After first successful
crystallizations, subsequent attempts worldwide became progressively
easier—suggesting the “template” for this crystal form strengthened with
each instantiation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Glycerine anecdote</strong>: This compound resisted
crystallization for decades despite many attempts. After the first
successful crystallization, labs worldwide reported simultaneous
success. Conventional explanation (seed contamination via traveling
scientists) fails to explain the global simultaneity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demodulation interpretation</strong>: Each successful
crystallization reinforces the morphic subcarrier for that crystal form.
New receivers (supersaturated solutions) can then more easily “tune in”
to the established template. The standing wave pattern for that crystal
structure becomes more stable with each instantiation.</p>
<p><strong>Rat Learning Experiments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>McDougall (1920-1954)</strong>: Successive generations of
rats learned water maze faster, even when selecting only slow learners
for breeding—eliminating genetic explanation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Crew replication (1936)</strong>: Attempted to refute
McDougall but found the same effect in control lines that had never been
trained.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agar replication (1954)</strong>: Used only slow-learning
progeny; still showed improvement across generations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demodulation interpretation</strong>: The “maze-solving
template” strengthens in the morphic field with each successful
learning. Later rats receive a stronger signal—they’re not learning from
scratch but demodulating an increasingly well-defined pattern. This is
precisely what the SAR integration model predicts: coherent repetition
amplifies template resolution.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>Demodulation interpretation</strong>: Standard neo-Darwinism
struggles to explain why evolution repeatedly “discovers” the same
complex solutions. The template model provides an answer: these aren’t
independent inventions but repeated demodulations of the same morphic
templates. The “eye template” exists in the torsion field; organisms
with appropriate receiver geometry (certain developmental pathways) can
tune in to it. Convergent evolution is convergent reception.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Supports the Demodulation Model</strong>: All three
evidence categories—crystallization, learning, and evolution—show the
same pattern: initial difficulty followed by increasing ease as the
template strengthens. This is exactly what a morphic field model
predicts: templates are real patterns that strengthen with instantiation
and become easier for subsequent receivers to demodulate.</p>
<h3 id="information-first-evidence">9.7 Information-First Evidence</h3>
<p><strong>Delayed Choice Experiments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wheeler’s delayed choice (1978, confirmed 2007)</strong>:
The decision of whether to measure “which path” can be made AFTER the
photon has already passed through the apparatus—yet this future choice
determines the photon’s past behavior. Information about measurement
determines physical outcome retroactively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delayed choice quantum eraser (Kim et al.,
2000)</strong>: Even when which-path information is recorded but later
erased, the interference pattern reappears—as if the photon “knew” the
information would be erased. The availability of information, not its
physical recording, determines the outcome.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demodulation interpretation</strong>: These experiments
demonstrate that information has causal priority over physical
configuration. The transaction model (Section 1.3) explains this: the
confirmation wave travels backward in time, so “future” measurement
choices are part of the transaction that creates the event. Reality is
woven from standing waves that include both forward and backward
temporal components.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum Biology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bird magnetoreception (Ritz et al., 2000; Hiscock et al.,
2016)</strong>: European robins navigate using quantum entanglement in
cryptochrome proteins. The radical pair mechanism maintains quantum
coherence at biological temperatures—something thought impossible until
recently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Photosynthesis efficiency (Engel et al., 2007)</strong>:
Quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes achieves near-100% energy
transfer efficiency. The system appears to “try all paths
simultaneously” before collapsing to the optimal one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enzyme catalysis (Klinman &amp; Kohen, 2013)</strong>:
Quantum tunneling allows enzymes to catalyze reactions that would be
classically forbidden. The enzyme “knows” where the particle needs to go
before the particle arrives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demodulation interpretation</strong>: Biological systems
exploit quantum effects far more than previously thought possible. The
torsion field model explains how: biological structures are themselves
standing wave patterns that maintain coherence with their morphic
templates. They don’t fight decoherence—they ARE coherent patterns
receiving from the field.</p>
<p><strong>Placebo and Nocebo Effects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Placebo surgery (Moseley et al., 2002)</strong>: Sham
knee surgery produced outcomes equal to real surgery for arthroscopic
procedures. Information (belief about treatment) produced physical
healing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nocebo death (Meador, 1992)</strong>: Documented cases of
“voodoo death” where belief in a curse produced fatal outcomes with no
physical cause.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demodulation interpretation</strong>: The body’s standing
wave pattern can be modified by information alone. Belief acts as a
tuning parameter, shifting which morphic templates the biological system
receives. Placebo/nocebo effects demonstrate that consciousness
(information state) directly modulates physical structure—exactly as the
filter theory predicts.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Supports the Demodulation Model</strong>:
Information-first evidence demonstrates that patterns (information) have
causal priority over physical matter. This is the core claim of the
demodulation framework: templates exist in the torsion field; physical
structures receive and express them. Delayed choice shows temporal
priority of information; quantum biology shows biological systems
maintaining coherent reception; placebo/nocebo shows consciousness
modulating the reception process. All converge on the same conclusion:
information is fundamental, matter is derivative.</p>
